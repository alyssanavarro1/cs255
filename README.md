Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The main project that was worked on for this course was the DriverPass project. DriverPass has a purpose of providing online driving education. They want to provide better training for people with their online courses and instructions.

What did you do particularly well?

I think I was able to analyze the system very well and effectivley represent abstract concepts like the sequence diagrams. The diagrams that were created during this class showed the different classes, activities, sequences and how the data flowed.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I could improve one part of my document I would improve my sequence diagram. I feel like it could have been represented better and there was definitely room for improvement. I think there could have been more thought put into it so I could fully understand how to show the sequence of events.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I crafted diagrams to show user interactions and I think I showed how things roll well. I think the systems were too complex and it needed someone to pay attention to be able to show how each class was utilized. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

In this course I was able to learn that I don't have to tackle it all at once. Rather I could gather what I know and then build upon it as time goes. This is a lot better than trying to cram everything in at the moment.
